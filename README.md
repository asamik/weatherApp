Have you ever asked yourself whether you should to bring a coat with you or not because you are not sure how hot and/or cold it will be?  
Well, this is my solution to the problem!
This is a small app that tells you what you should wear, depending on the temperature forecast provided by Weather Underground API (http://www.wunderground.com/).  Although it automatically locates your city with your IP Address, you can also search the weather in other cities of your choice.
